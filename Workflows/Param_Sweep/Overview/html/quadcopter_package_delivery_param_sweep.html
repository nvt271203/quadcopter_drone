<h1>Quadcopter Package Delivery, Parameter Sweeps</h1>
<!--introduction-->
<p>This example models a quadcopter that navigates a path to deliver a package. The body was designed in CAD and imported into Simscape Multibody. The electric motors capture the dynamics of the power conversion in an abstract manner to enable fast simulation. The package is released from the quadcopter when it reaches the final waypoint and the release criteria are met.</p>
<p>The design space for the quadcopter and the missions it performs is explored by conducting a set of parameter sweeps.</p>

%% Quadcopter Package Delivery, Parameter Sweeps
% 
% This example models a quadcopter that navigates a path to deliver a
% package. The body was designed in CAD and imported into Simscape
% Multibody.  The electric motors capture the dynamics of the power
% conversion in an abstract manner to enable fast simulation.  The package
% is released from the quadcopter when it reaches the final waypoint and
% the release criteria are met.
%
% The design space for the quadcopter and the missions it performs is
% explored by conducting a set of parameter sweeps.

%% Parameter Sweep: Package Mass
% Using parallel computing we vary the mass of the package to see its
% effect on the quadcopter trajectory.

%% Parameter Sweep: Trajectory Speed
% Using parallel computing we vary the target speed of the quadcopter and
% see if the quadcopter can follow the target path.

%% Parameter Sweep: Mass and Wind
% Using parallel computing we vary the mass of the package and the strength
% of wind gusts that strike the quadcopter during the test.

%% Parameter Sweep: Mass and Air Temperature
% Using parallel computing we vary the mass of the package and the
