# **Quadcopter Drone Model in Simscape**
Copyright 2021-2023 The MathWorks, Inc.

This example models a quadcopter that navigates a path to deliver a package. 
* **Electric motors and battery** enable estimation of current draw and drone range
* **CAD files of the chassis and propellers** model the mechanical system
* **Cascaded PID controllers** adjust motor speeds to control altitude and attitude
* **Path following and speed controllers** provide high-level commands 
* **Python queries to a weather database** obtain location-specific wind conditions
* **Wind gust profiles** test stability of drone controllers
* **Profitability analysis in a MATLAB App** enables exploring technical and business tradeoffs
